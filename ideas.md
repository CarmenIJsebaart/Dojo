Richel:
* perhaps we should simple meet somewhere (not in a pub) on Thursday?
* initial focus should be on more teaching ourselves to more advanced students
* starting date: when course content is done
* notifying DJO: when there is a sketch of the course content
* I'd like to use DIYbio to provide us a new emaillist, e.g thursday@diybiogroningen.nl, instead of this list of addresses
* course content I am willing to teach: connecting shift registers to Arduino


Thijs:
* More programming: Arduino, Android apps and C++
* Explore new topics before doing these on Friday, e.g. Raspberry Pi
* Behind the scenes, prepare and improve Friday: improve documentation and GitHub structure. Perhaps same for the Makercourse
* Projects on Thursday, so on Friday we can focus on education and the kids
* I'd like to investigate Android apps
* I hope someone finds out how to use Raspberry Pi
